# ðŸš€ <span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>| Ecosystem Overview</span>

Cucumber<span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>Trade</span> sits at the intersection of AI, on-chain data, and modular DeFi tooling. 

We leveraged the CreatorBid platform to launch our flagship AI agentâ€”ensuring a fair, transparent rollout with no insider rounds or hidden capsâ€”and established our home base on Base, chosen for its low gas fees, fast finality, and Ethereum compatibility. 

From this foundation, our ecosystem will grow to deliver everything a serious on-chain trader needs: advanced analytics, seamless AI coaching, robust execution rails, and cross-chain expansion.

## <span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>Our Pillars</span>

1. Foundation: A fair, community-governed launch on CreatorBid combined with the performance and low-fee environment of Base to underpin every feature.
2. Core Services & Tools: AI-driven wallet analysis, rich analytics dashboards, and real-time alerts that turn raw on-chain data into actionable trading insights.
3. Execution & Integration: Seamless trading rails via native DEX SDKs, future autonomous agents, and robust APIs/webhooks to plug Cucumber insights into any workflow.
