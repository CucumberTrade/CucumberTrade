Cucumber<span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>Trade</span> sits at the intersection of AI, on-chain data, and modular DeFi tooling. We leveraged CreatorBid for a fair, transparent rollout of our flagship AI agent and chose Base for its low fees and fast finality. From this foundation, our ecosystem will expand to deliver everything a serious on-chain trader needs: advanced analytics, seamless AI coaching, robust execution rails, and cross-chain expansion.
