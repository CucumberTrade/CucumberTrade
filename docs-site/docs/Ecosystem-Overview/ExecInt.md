  Optional Flashbots integration helps you avoid front-runs and sandwich attacks, keeping your large orders safe.

  Batch common operations (swaps, approvals, transfers) into single transactions to save on fees and reduce chain congestion.

## <span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>Open Integrations</span>
- <span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>**REST API & Webhooks**</span>

  JavaScript and Python SDKs plus upcoming MetaMask Snaps let you embed our AI agents and execution logic into any UI or wallet.
