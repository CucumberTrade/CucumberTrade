Launchpad & Foundation

By integrating with CreatorBid, every participant enjoyed equal access to our AI agent from day one. BID token holders co-govern the protocol, shaping our roadmap and sharing in usage-fee incentives. Simultaneously, Base serves as our primary chain: its Layer 2 scaling delivers the performance required for real-time behavior analysis and frequent smart contract calls. As we scale, additional rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.) will be onboarded to broaden our reach and enable cross-chain strategies.
