<span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>CreatorBid</span>


By integrating with <span style={{ color: '#93FF11'}}>CreatorBid</span>, every participant enjoyed equal access to our flagship AI agent from day one. BID token holders co-govern the protocol, shaping our roadmap and sharing in usage-fee incentives. Simultaneously, Base serves as our primary chain: its Layer 2 scaling delivers the performance required for real-time behavior analysis and frequent smart contract calls. As we continue to scale, additional rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, and beyond) will be onboarded to broaden our reach and enable sophisticated cross-chain strategies.
