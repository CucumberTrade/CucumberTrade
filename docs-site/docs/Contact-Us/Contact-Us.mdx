“Security is a partnership—your vigilance and adherence to these guidelines help us protect everyone.”

:::warning[Security Reminder]
At Cucumber Trades, safeguarding your assets and data is a joint effort. Please review and follow these essential security practices:
1. Direct Messages (DMs)
    - Our team and community moderators will never reach out via DM unless you’ve first connected in an official Cucumber Trades channel.
    - Treat any unsolicited DM as a potential red flag—always verify before engaging.

2. Protect Your Sensitive Data
    - We will never ask for your wallet seed phrase, private keys, or funds.
    - Keep all credentials, API keys, and personal information strictly to yourself—sharing them puts your account and assets at risk.

3. Verify Every Contact
    - Always cross-check any outreach from “Cucumber Trades” by visiting our official Discord, Twitter, or Telegram channels.
    - Genuine communications come only from our verified handles; if in doubt, confirm via our website’s “Support” page before taking action.

Thank you for your cooperation.
